        <h1>Master Of Puppets</h1>

        <p>End of passion play<br>
            Crumbling away<br>
            I'm your source of self-destruction<br>
            Veins that pump with fear<br>
            Sucking darkeness clear<br>
            Leading on your death's construction<br>
            Taste me, you will see<br>
            More is all you need<br>
            Dedicated to<br>
            How I'm killing you<br>
            Come crawling faster (faster)<br>
            Obey your master (master)<br>
            Your life burns faster (faster)<br>
            Obey your<br>
            Master<br>
            Master<br>
            Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings<br>
            Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams<br>
            Blinded by me, you can't see a thing<br>
            Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream<br>
            Master<br>
            Master<br>
            Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream<br>
            Master<br>
            Master<br>
            Needlework the way<br>
            Never you betray<br>
            Life of death becoming clearer<br>
            Pain monopoly<br>
            Ritual misery<br>
            Chop your breakfast on a mirror<br>
            Taste me you will see<br>
            More is all you need<br>
            Dedicated to<br>
            How I'm killing you<br>
            Come crawling faster (faster)<br>
            Obey your master (master)<br>
            Your life burns faster (faster)<br>

            Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream<br>
            Master<br>
            Master<br>
            Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream<br>
            Master<br>

            Master<br>
            Master<br>
            Where's the dreams that I've been after?<br>
            Master<br>
            Master<br>
            Promised only lies<br>
            Laughter<br>
            Laughter<br>
            All I hear or see is laughter<br>
            Laughter<br>
            Laughter<br>
            Laughing at my cries<br>
            Fix me<br>
            Hell is worth all that<br>
            Natural habitat<br>
            Just a rhyme without a reason<br>
            Never-ending maze<br>
            Drift on numbered days<br>
            Now your life is out of season<br>
            I will occupy<br>
            I will help you die<br>
            I will run through you<br>
            Now I rule you too<br>
            Come crawling faster (faster)<br>
            Obey your master (master)<br>
            Your life burns faster (faster)<br>
            Obey your master<br>
            Master<br>
            Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings<br>
            Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams<br>
            Blinded by me, you can't see a thing<br>
            Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream<br>
            Master<br>
            Master
            Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream<br>
            Master<br>
